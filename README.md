# UAMSim
A basic one-dimensional kinematics simulation

*This project is a simple 1d visualization of the vector quantities of displacement, velocity, and acceleration. 
*The user can control position 'x' with the left mouse button, as well as acceleration 'a' with the right mouse button. 
*Vectors and graphs are rendered in real time using CanvasRenderingContext2D.
